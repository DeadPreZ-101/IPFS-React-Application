## Description

This is a simple IPFS Web Application where you can upload an image to the IPFS and get a hash of the image. You can then retrieve you image again by submitting your image hash. 



## Instructions

- Run 'npm install' to get the dependencies installed.
- Run 'npm start' to start the web interface.
- Upload an image by clicking the 'Select Image' button, and choosing an image from your PC; then press the 'Submit' button to upload the image.
- Enter the account adress you want to check, to retrieve the hash from that account.

## Note

- The contract address and ABI must be updated with local deployment. 
- Port might have to be updated (I am using Ganache).
